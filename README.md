🚨 The Problem
Sugar is everywhere — and that’s the problem.

Linked to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and countless chronic conditions, refined sugar is under increasing scrutiny. But the alternatives? They're not perfect either:

🌱 Natural sweeteners (like stevia or erythritol) may be healthier — but don’t always work across recipes or taste profiles
🧪 Ingredient interactions can distort flavor, texture, or aroma when sweeteners are substituted
🔬 In R&D, it’s impossible to physically test every sweetener in every food matrix
🏭 Manufacturers waste time and money trialing formulations with uncertain outcomes

👨‍🍳 Consumers want healthy.
🏢 Industry wants efficiency.
🔬 Science wants precision.

Until now, there’s been no tool that brings it all together.

✅ The Solution: Sweeter-Native, powered by SweetPredict
A breakthrough AI platform that combines molecular modeling, taste prediction, and dietary context to recommend the best sugar alternatives — personalized for any user, recipe, or product.

Whether you're a home cook, food technologist, or R&D scientist, this tool helps you build smarter, healthier, tastier foods — faster.

🧠 What Makes It Different?
🧬 Molecular-Level Predictions
We analyze sweeteners based on their chemical structure (SMILES) and use ML models to predict:
Sweetness Index
Aftertaste Score
Models: Random Forest (for sweetness) + CNN (for flavor/aftertaste)

🤖 LLM-Powered Recommendation Engine
Our agentic AI framework factors in:
Full recipe & ingredient context
User health conditions or goals
Flavor interactions between molecules
Scientific sweetener rankings & constraints

🧪 A Tool for Everyone
This isn’t just a consumer gadget — it's a science-backed toolkit for:

🏭 Manufacturers optimizing sugar-free formulations
🧪 R&D labs accelerating food product development
🍽 Nutrition startups building personalized food experiences
🧑‍⚕ Dietitians crafting smarter health recommendations

🚀 Quick Start Guide
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Generate Molecular Data
python generate-csv.py
Processes sweetener structures and outputs sweetness.csv + flavor.csv

3️⃣ Train the Models
python sweetness_train.py    # Random Forest for sweetness
python cnn_train.py          # CNN for flavor/aftertaste

4️⃣ Launch the App
streamlit run app.py
